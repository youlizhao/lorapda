## Introduction

This repository contains code for the paper submitted to a journal. The conference version was published in IEEE SECON 2022, and can be found via https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9918167/.

We develop a new algorithm named LoRa Physical-layer Data Aggregation (LoRaPDA or LoRaPPA) to realize multi-packet reception when several LoRa nodes transmits concurrently with a small time offset (TO). The source codes show an runnning example of the algorithm.

## How to Run
